<b>Zend</b><br> <A HREF='http://www.zend.com' TARGET=STD4>Zend</A>  provides many tools for PHP programmers. It also maintains the PHP sourcecode. It's tools are closed-source and have a pricetag. Most of them, that is.<br>

<b>Microcode</b><br> <A HREF='http://www.microcode.de' TARGET=STD4>Microcode PHP encoder</A> This German company has released a <b>free and open</b> competitor to Zend Encoder in august 2001. Check it out. I wonder whether is works together with APC. Maybe they can team up.<br>

 <A HREF='http://www.gnu.org' TARGET=STD4>GNU - Free Software Foundation</A> The GNU Project was launched in 1984 to develop a complete Unix-like operating system which is free software: the GNU system. (GNU is a recursive acronym for ``GNU's Not Unix''; it is pronounced "guh-NEW".) Variants of the GNU operating system, which use the kernel Linux, are now widely used; though these systems are often referred to as ``Linux'', they are more accurately called GNU/Linux systems.<br>
